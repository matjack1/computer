# Computer

On how to setup my computer.

## Prerequisites

- Ubuntu 18.04
- Firefox synced with my account

Firefox will get also the LastPass extension from which I can easily unlock all my passwords. And with Sync I retain all of my links and settings.

## Setup script

Running the `setup` I should be able to install as much stuff as possible.

## Login

Once the setup has finished, launch Dropbox and sync the folder locally. This will also get the SSH keys used to log in around.
